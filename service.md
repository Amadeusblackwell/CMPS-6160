## Optional Service Learning Component

* **Lectures:** Thursdays, August 20 - November 24th, 2020.
* **Room:** Stanley Thomas Hall ([Building 10](https://tulane.edu/maps-directions)) 
* **Online:** All Lectures will be on Zoom, see [Tulane Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) for details.
* **Time:** 18:25 - 19:20

The Partners for this semester are:
* **Partner:** [Code For New Orleans](http://codeforneworleans.org/)
  * **Primary Contact**: Ryan Harvey, <ryan@codeforneworleans.org>
* **Partner:** [The Data Center](https://www.datacenterresearch.org/)
  * **Primary Contact:** Lamar Gardere, <lamarg@datacenterresearch.org>

All additional information is available on the [Service Learning Page](./service).

The aim of the service learning component of this course is twofold: (1) to encourage students to apply their data science skills to local issues and (2) to deeply think and engage with where data comes from, why it is collected, and who data centric systems may affect.  Thus through service learning and civic engagement students will be able to *apply* the skills they learn in this class to important problems in our local community.

Those students enrolled in the service learning component of this course will fulfill their second tier service learning requirement as this is a 3000 level class.  Students will have a 20 hour service learning obligation which will be fulfilled by attending meetings with our community partner, Code for NOLA, and by working on their final project which will focus on applications to the community.  In addition, students will be required to complete four written reflections both on their attendance at Code for NOLA meetings and on required readings.

[Code for New Orleans](http://codeforneworleans.org/) is a group of local volunteers focused on making city services accessible and easy to use and improving the lives of residents. Code for NOLA is a brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a national non-profit focused on civic activism with technology in local contexts across our nation.

Students will be required to attend the Code for NOLA meetings to engage with the community of developers working to use code and data to improve access too and understanding of city data in New Orleans.  The final project that students complete in this course will be focused on using data from either the city of New Orleans or another local/regional data source identified in conjunction with the instructor and Code for NOLA volunteers.

**Note:** Attendance and interaction with the community is a requirement for the optional Service Learning portions of the course.  If you do not attend the meetings and reflections you will not pass this component of the course.  Specifically the service learning component of the course will be graded as follows.

*	25% - Attendance at 5 required meetings.
*   50% - Reflection Papers.
*   25% - Evaluation of Final Tutorial as made by the instructor and Code for NOLA volunteers.

### Required Meetings.

**Kickoff Meeting:** The volunteers at Code for NOLA will work with students in an initial kickoff meeting to outline the services and goals of the organization; show students examples of past work, and engage in a dialog on possible data science projects for the semester.

**Regular Code for NOLA Meetings:** In order to engage the students in the community of developers working to improve the city using data and technology, students will be required to attend the regular meetings of Code for NOLA during the semester.  

During the Fall 2020 semester the meetings will take place at [LaunchPad](https://lp.co/) a startup incubator downtown at 400 Poydras Street, Suite 900, New Orleans, LA, 70130.  The location can be easily accessed by a short walk from the [1500 Poydras Dropoff of the Green Shuttle Line](https://shuttles.tulane.edu/content/fixed-shuttle-lines) or by the RTA St. Charles Streetcar.  Specifically, students will attend on:
* Sept 10, 2020.
* Oct 8, 2020.
* Nov 12, 2020.

These meetings typically go from 7p to 9:30p (students can depart earlier).  Most of the meeting is time to work in small groups on projects so students are encouraged to use this time to engage with other developers to improve their projects.

**Final Presentation:** In addition to their final pitch in class, students in the service learning component will have an extra presentation to the volunteers at Code for NOLA to receive feedback and discussion on their project.  Feedback from the Code for NOLA volunteers will factor into the total grade students receive in the evaluation of their Final Tutorial.

### Reflections.

In addition to the focus of their main final project, students will be expected to complete four required reflections as part of the service learning component of the course.  Grades for these reflections (12.5% each) will be a crucial component of their service learning component grade.  The reflections will be graded on the clarity of presentation, grammatical and structural coherence, and the critical thoughtfulness of the reflection essay's response to the prompts outlined below.  These prompts will help you think about some of the themes and ideas we will be learning about in class and lectures especially as it comes to the **application of Data Science to communities and problems in those communities**.  Additional resources and readings for this section come from [Berkeley's Human Context and Ethics of Data Science Course](https://hce-sts.org/).

Reflections will be equally spaced throughout the semester including after the first and last meeting with the Code for NOLA volunteers.

* *Prompt 1*: Reflect on our kickoff meeting at Code for NOLA.  What aspects of technology were you surprised to learn that they needed help with?  What does this say about our community and the city?
* *Prompt 2*: Respond to the readings from Cathy O'Neil's Weapons of Math Destruction.  Specifically, think about some of the ways data science can have unintended consequences.  Is there anything you might reveal in the course of your project that you are concerned about? 
* *Prompt 3*: Read S. Barocas and d. boyd (2017) "Engaging the Ethics of Data Science in Practice," Communications of the ACM, Vol. 60 No. 11, Pages 23-25.  This paper deals directly with ethics and community impact in the area of data science.  Think about your project, where the data comes from, who it impacts, and what you hope to achieve.  Discuss the ethical implications of your work in this context.
* *Prompt 4*: Reflect on your final presentation at Code for NOLA.  Were you happy with how it went?  What questions did you get that you were not ready for?  Was there something that you didn't think of that was raised during the presentation or review?
