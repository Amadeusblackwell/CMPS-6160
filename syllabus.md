## Catalog / Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide the student with an introduction to the main concepts and techniques required for collecting, processing, and deriving insight into data. Data Science is an interdisciplinary set of topics that includes everything you need to create data driven answers and solutions to specific business, scientific, or sociological questions. Topics typically covered include an introduction to one or more data collection and management systems, e.g., SQL, web scraping, and various data repositories; exploratory and statistical data analysis, e.g., bootstrapping, measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques including linear regression and clustering; data and information visualization, e.g., plotting and interactive charts using various technologies; and presentation and communication of the results of these analyses.

**Prerequisite**: CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II and CMPS/MATH 2170 Discrete Mathematics.

**Note.** This is a programming and mathematics intensive class.  Students are expected to know the basics of Python and be able to navigate a Linux/Unix command prompt (the first programming assignment will test these abilities).  Likewise a working understanding of graph theory, probability theory, and an understanding of basic algorithms is expected.

## Course Objectives and Overview:

Data Science is an interdisciplinary set of topics that includes everything you need to create data driven answers and solutions to specific business, scientific, or sociological questions. The goal of data science is to improve decision making based on insights from data. As a field, Data Science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting nonobvious and useful patterns from datasets.

This course will cover:
1. Data management systems, e.g., SQL, web scraping, and various data repositories;
2. Exploratory and statistical data analysis, e.g., bootstrapping, measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques including linear regression and clustering;
3. Data and information visualization, e.g., plotting and interactive charts using various technologies; and
4. Presentation and communication of results.


The course will use Python and be largely project and case study driven with students expected to analyze real datasets and post an analysis/tutorial publicly on GitHub at the end of the course. **Note that this is a programming intensive course and familiarity with Python is expected.**

Students should be comfortable with programming in at least one language (preferably [Python](https://www.python.org/)) and have had a reasonable amount of math including some linear algebra and algorithms (we’re going to dissect some algorithms later in the class [including PCA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf) so you should know what a matrix is and you should be comfortable with everything in CMPS/MATH 2170).  

We’ll be using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) and a number of packages including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [SciKit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html).  You’ll be turning in projects using [GitHub](https://education.github.com/students) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so make sure you have an account!


## Course Learning Outcomes:

At the conclusion of this course students will be able to:
* Open, load, and manipulate data from various sources using industry standard tools.
* Be able to use one or more data management and storage systems to load, explore, and clean data.
* Be able to perform basic statistical analysis of the data including generating summary tables of various statistics and visualization.
* Be able to express trends and implications present in data through the use of statistical hypothesis testing including p-values and confidence intervals.
* Be able to use one or more machine learning algorithms for classification and regression.
* Be able to present the results of a complete data analysis in written, visual, and presentation form.


## Program-Level Outcomes:

This course fulfills the requirement of **one** of the CMPS 3000-level or above courses required for the coordinate major in computer science.  Students need to complete three such courses in order to complete the requirements for a coordinate major.  For more information on the coordinate major please see the requirements at [the Registrar's Website](https://catalog.tulane.edu/science-engineering/computer-science/computer-science-coordinate-major/#requirementstext)

## Required and Suggested Student Resources			

There is no required textbook for this course.  However, we will make extensive use of online textbooks and articles for the required reading that you will be quizzed on.  You will also need access to a computer that you can install the required software ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)).  If you do not have access to a computer please see me ASAP.

## Evaluation Procedures and Grading Criteria

This course will consist of four distinct grading areas.  Note that all point values described below for individual assignments are subject to change, the area percentages will remain the same.
*	10% - In Class Activities, Participation, and Weekly Questions
*   30% - Mini-Projects and Labs
*   30% - Final Project (Service Learning Project)
*   10% - Midterm Exam
*	10% - Final Exam

**In Class Activities, Participation, and Weekly Questions.** Throughout the semester we will regularly complete short in class exercises such as brainstorming activities, think-pair-share, pre/post questions, and short answer writing.  In addition I will post a multiple choice and short answer quiz (about) every Tuesday on Canvas which will be due the following Tuesday before midnight.  The questions will cover various topics discussed in class as well as items from the readings that will be assigned. (\~10 points each).

**Mini-Projects:** There will be between 4-6 "mini-projects" assigned over the course of the semester (plus one simple setup assignment that will walk you through using git, Docker, and Jupyter).  The projects will be posted at [https://github.com/TulaneIntroDataScience/fall2019](https://github.com/TulaneIntroDataScience/fall2019) and will be assigned in Canvas. The best way to learn is by doing, so these will largely be applied assignments that provide hands-on experience with the basic skills a data scientist needs in industry. **Posting solutions publicly online without the staff's express consent is a direct violation of our academic integrity policy. Late assignments will not be accepted.** \~25 points for the first project, \~100 for all others).

**Labs:** We will run Labs in class a couple of times throughout the semester and give you an opportunity to work through problems hands on with me and the TAs.  On these days it will be important to bring a laptop to class to participate in the work.  Labs will be worth \~10 points each and graded based on completion.

**Midterm and Final Exam:** This will be a written, close book, in class exam.  You are allowed one **hand-written** cheat sheet, front and back, 8.5x11 inch paper.  This will be turned in with your exam.

**Final Project:** In the interest of building students' public portfolios, and in the spirit of "learning by doing", students will create a self-contained online tutorial to be posted publicly and a 5-minute presentation in class. This tutorial can be created individually or in a small group (Max 2 people). This assignment will be a publicly-accessible website that provides an end-to-end walkthrough of identifying and scraping a specific data source, performing some exploratory analysis, and providing some sort of managerial or operational insight from that data.  We will have several milestones associated with the final project including the following.
1. Identifying a dataset and establishing a GitHub.io Site. (\~25 points)
2. Extraction, Transform, and Load (ETL) + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Your notebook from Part 1 but expanded to include the data being loaded and showing that you have figured out how to get the data into your system.  In addition, include some graphs, visualizations, and stats that show you can manipulate your data and understand the dataset you are working with. (\~50 points)
3. A final, in class presentation. (\~50 points)
4. A final tutorial and website. (\~75 points)

**Late Work Policy.**  All work must be turned in on time unless explicit consent for outstanding circumstances is given beforehand (or in the case of illness, with a documented absence after).  Any late work will be penalized at **20% of the total assignment value per day up to 5 days late, after which it will not be accepted**.  The exception to this rule is if work solutions are presented in class (as is the case with labs and quizzes).  **After the work is presented in class, no late work will be accepted.**

**Late Tokens.** At the start of this semester you each are holding **3 late tokens** which can be redeemed at any time for mini-projects and labs only.  Each token is worth one additional day, to use at your discretion.  These tokens have no cash value but are worth 1% to your mini-project and lab grade at the end of the semester.

**Final Grade Policy:** The weighted average will determine your letter grade roughly as follows, +/- grades will be given for borderline cases.
* A >= 90%
* B >= 80%
* C >= 70%
* D >= 60%
* F < 60% 

**All grades will be posted on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) throughout the semester.**

**Additional Work for Graduate Students**: Graduate students who enroll in this course will be required to complete 1-2 extra questions on all Mini-Project Assignments.  In addition to these extra questions, graduate students will be expected to produce an additional written project which investigates a dataset from their primary field of study.  The report will discuss this dataset and propose an analysis using an advanced technique from Data Science to be decided in conjunction with the instructor.  This will be a 100 point project.

## Attendance

**Students are required to attend all classes and labs unless they are ill or prevented from attending by exceptional circumstances and with a valid excuse note.** Students are responsible for notifying instructors about absences that result from serious illnesses, injuries, or critical personal problems.  **Students with frequent absences will be reported and/or removed from the course according to university policy.**

## Use of Electronic Devices

Please silence your cellphones during class.  If you want to use a laptop or other device with a large screen for note taking please sit in the back rows of the classroom -- it’s distracting to other students [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/)

**Note:** There will be a few “interactive lab days” where we will explicitly encourage you to bring your laptop (if available) and follow along with the tutorial.

## Optional Service Learning Component

The aim of the service learning component of this course is twofold: (1) to encourage students to apply their data science skills to local issues and (2) to deeply think and engage with where data comes from, why it is collected, and who data centric systems may affect.  Thus through service learning and civic engagement students will be able to *apply* the skills they learn in this class to important problems in our local community.

Those students enrolled in the service learning component of this course will fulfill their second tier service learning requirement as this is a 3000 level class.  Students will have a 20 hour service learning obligation which will be fulfilled by attending meetings with our community partner, Code for NOLA, and by working on their final project which will focus on applications to the community.  In addition, students will be required to complete four written reflections both on their attendance at Code for NOLA meetings and on required readings.

[Code for New Orleans](http://codeforneworleans.org/) is a group of local volunteers focused on making city services accessible and easy to use and improving the lives of residents. Code for NOLA is a brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a national non-profit focused on civic activism with technology in local contexts across our nation.

Students will be required to attend the Code for NOLA meetings to engage with the community of developers working to use code and data to improve access too and understanding of city data in New Orleans.  The final project that students complete in this course will be focused on using data from either the city of New Orleans or another local/regional data source identified in conjunction with the instructor and Code for NOLA volunteers.

**Note:** Attendance and interaction with the community is a requirement for the optional Service Learning portions of the course.  If you do not attend the meetings and reflections you will not pass this component of the course.  Specifically the service learning component of the course will be graded as follows.

*	25% - Attendance at 5 required meetings.
*   50% - Reflection Papers.
*   25% - Evaluation of Final Tutorial as made by the instructor and Code for NOLA volunteers.

### Required Meetings.

**Kickoff Meeting:** The volunteers at Code for NOLA will work with students in an initial kickoff meeting to outline the services and goals of the organization; show students examples of past work, and engage in a dialog on possible data science projects for the semester.

**Regular Code for NOLA Meetings:** In order to engage the students in the community of developers working to improve the city using data and technology, students will be required to attend the regular meetings of Code for NOLA during the semester.  

During the Fall 2020 semester the meetings will take place at [LaunchPad](https://lp.co/) a startup incubator downtown at 400 Poydras Street, Suite 900, New Orleans, LA, 70130.  The location can be easily accessed by a short walk from the [1500 Poydras Dropoff of the Green Shuttle Line](https://shuttles.tulane.edu/content/fixed-shuttle-lines) or by the RTA St. Charles Streetcar.  Specifically, students will attend on:
* Sept 10, 2020.
* Oct 8, 2020.
* Nov 12, 2020.

These meetings typically go from 7p to 9:30p (students can depart earlier).  Most of the meeting is time to work in small groups on projects so students are encouraged to use this time to engage with other developers to improve their projects.

**Final Presentation:** In addition to their final pitch in class, students in the service learning component will have an extra presentation to the volunteers at Code for NOLA to receive feedback and discussion on their project.  Feedback from the Code for NOLA volunteers will factor into the total grade students receive in the evaluation of their Final Tutorial.

### Reflections.

In addition to the focus of their main final project, students will be expected to complete four required reflections as part of the service learning component of the course.  Grades for these reflections (12.5% each) will be a crucial component of their service learning component grade.  The reflections will be graded on the clarity of presentation, grammatical and structural coherence, and the critical thoughtfulness of the reflection essay's response to the prompts outlined below.  These prompts will help you think about some of the themes and ideas we will be learning about in class and lectures especially as it comes to the **application of Data Science to communities and problems in those communities**.  Additional resources and readings for this section come from [Berkeley's Human Context and Ethics of Data Science Course](https://hce-sts.org/).

Reflections will be equally spaced throughout the semester including after the first and last meeting with the Code for NOLA volunteers.

* *Prompt 1*: Reflect on our kickoff meeting at Code for NOLA.  What aspects of technology were you surprised to learn that they needed help with?  What does this say about our community and the city?
* *Prompt 2*: Respond to the readings from Cathy O'Neil's Weapons of Math Destruction.  Specifically, think about some of the ways data science can have unintended consequences.  Is there anything you might reveal in the course of your project that you are concerned about? 
* *Prompt 3*: Read S. Barocas and d. boyd (2017) "Engaging the Ethics of Data Science in Practice," Communications of the ACM, Vol. 60 No. 11, Pages 23-25.  This paper deals directly with ethics and community impact in the area of data science.  Think about your project, where the data comes from, who it impacts, and what you hope to achieve.  Discuss the ethical implications of your work in this context.
* *Prompt 4*: Reflect on your final presentation at Code for NOLA.  Were you happy with how it went?  What questions did you get that you were not ready for?  Was there something that you didn't think of that was raised during the presentation or review?
