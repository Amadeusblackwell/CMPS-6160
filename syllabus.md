# Catalog / Course Description
The aim of this course is to provide the student with an introduction to the main concepts and techniques required for collecting, processing, and deriving insight into data. Data Science is an interdisciplinary set of topics that includes everything you need to create data driven answers and solutions to specific business, scientific, or sociological questions. Topics typically covered include an introduction to one or more data collection and management systems, e.g., SQL, web scraping, and various data repositories; exploratory and statistical data analysis, e.g., bootstrapping, measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques including linear regression and clustering; data and information visualization, e.g., plotting and interactive charts using various technologies; and presentation and communication of the results of these analyses.

**Prerequisite:** CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II and CMPS/MATH 2170 Discrete Mathematics.

**Note:** This is a programming and mathematics intensive class.  Students are expected to know the basics of Python and be able to navigate a Linux/Unix command prompt (the first programming assignment will test these abilities).  Likewise a working understanding of graph theory, probability theory, and an understanding of basic algorithms is expected.

## Course Objectives and Overview
Data Science is an interdisciplinary set of topics that includes everything you need to create data driven answers and solutions to specific business, scientific, or sociological questions. The goal of data science is to improve decision making based on insights from data. As a field, Data Science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting nonobvious and useful patterns from datasets.

This course will cover:
1. Data management systems, e.g., SQL, web scraping, and various data repositories;
2. Exploratory and statistical data analysis, e.g., bootstrapping, measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques including linear regression and clustering;
3. Data and information visualization, e.g., plotting and interactive charts using various technologies; and
4. Presentation and communication of results.

The course will use Python and be largely project and case study driven with students expected to analyze real datasets and post an analysis/tutorial publicly on GitHub at the end of the course. **Note that this is a programming intensive course and familiarity with Python is expected.**

Students should be comfortable with programming in at least one language (preferably [Python](https://www.python.org/)) and have had a reasonable amount of math including some linear algebra and algorithms.  You you should know what a matrix is and you should be comfortable with everything in CMPS/MATH 2170.  There are many helpful tutorials and background material at the [Links & Resources Page](./resources.md), please make use of it.

We’ll be using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) and a number of packages including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [SciKit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html).  You’ll be turning in projects using [GitHub](https://education.github.com/students) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so make sure you have an account!

## Course Learning Outcomes
At the conclusion of this course students will be able to:
* Open, load, and manipulate data from various sources using industry standard tools.
* Be able to use one or more data management and storage systems to load, explore, and clean data.
* Be able to perform basic statistical analysis of the data including generating summary tables of various statistics and visualization.
* Be able to express trends and implications present in data through the use of statistical hypothesis testing including p-values and confidence intervals.
* Be able to use one or more machine learning algorithms for classification and regression.
* Be able to present the results of a complete data analysis in written, visual, and presentation form.

## Program-Level Outcomes
This course fulfills the requirement of **one** of the CMPS 3000-level or above courses required for the coordinate major in computer science.  Students need to complete three such courses in order to complete the requirements for a coordinate major.  For more information on the coordinate major please see the requirements at [the Registrar's Website](https://catalog.tulane.edu/science-engineering/computer-science/computer-science-coordinate-major/#requirementstext)

# Evaluation Procedures and Grading Criteria
This course will consist of seven distinct grading areas.  Note that all point values described below for individual assignments are subject to change, the area percentages will remain the same.
*	  5% - In Class Activities, Participation, Online Questions.
*   5% - Attendance
*   25% - Mini-Projects
*   15% - Labs
*   30% - Final Project (Service Learning Project)
*   10% - Midterm Exam
*	  10% - Final Exam

### Attendance
Attendance will be monitored through an in-class survey (nearly) every day of class.  You are required to fill out this survey every day, synchronously in class unless you contact me to make alternative arrangements.

### In Class Activities, Participation, and Questions
Throughout the semester we will regularly complete short in class exercises such as brainstorming activities, think-pair-share, pre/post questions, and short answer writing. As we are online sometimes this may include posting things on the discussion board or answering a short quiz in Canvas on additional readings.  This may also include presenting/explaining answers to labs in class.

### Mini-Projects (15 hours each) 
There will be between 2-3 "mini-projects" assigned over the course of the semester (plus one simple setup assignment that will walk you through using git, Docker, and Jupyter).  The projects will be posted on the [Assignments Page](./assignments.md) and will be assigned in [Tulane Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/). The best way to learn is by doing, so these will largely be applied assignments that provide hands-on experience with the basic skills a data scientist needs in industry. **Posting solutions publicly online without the staff's express consent is a direct violation of our academic integrity policy. Late assignments will not be accepted.** \~50 points for the first project, \~100 for all others).

**Note:** For the Fall 2020 semester Project 1 and 2 may be completed as a group.  We will post more details when they are assigned.  Collaboration plans will be required.

### Labs (2 hours each)
We will run Labs in class a couple of times throughout the semester and give you an opportunity to work through problems hands on with me and the TAs.  On these days it will be important to bring a laptop to class to participate in the work.  Labs will be worth \~15 points each and graded based on completion / effort.

### Midterm and Final Exam 
This will be a written, close book, in class (online) exam.  You are allowed one **hand-written** cheat sheet, front and back, 8.5x11 inch paper.  You will be required to turn in this cheat sheet **before** the actual exam and it will be graded for completeness. The final is cumulative.  This semester both exams will take place online, however you must be in the Zoom call to turn in and receive credit for taking the exam unless prior arrangements have been made. **You must earn at least a 60% average between the two exams to pass the course.**

To take the tests you need to get ready and get a Scan to PDF app ([see useful links here](https://fossbytes.com/best-android-scanner-apps/)).  Scanning is built into many phones now so please get ready, we will have a participation assignment that has you do this before the tests.  **We will not accept pictures, you must upload PDFs to Canvas.  It is also your responsibility to check your PDFs when they are submitted -- if we can't read them we can't grade them.  If you cannot do this please contact me ASAP.**

### Final Project 
In the interest of building students' public portfolios, and in the spirit of "learning by doing", students will create a self-contained online tutorial to be posted publicly and a 5-minute presentation in class. This tutorial can be created individually or in a small group (Max 2 people, except graduate students). This assignment will be a publicly-accessible website that provides an end-to-end walk-through of identifying and scraping a specific data source, performing some exploratory analysis, and providing some sort of managerial or operational insight from that data.  We will have several milestones associated with the final project:
1. Identifying a dataset and establishing a GitHub.io Site, Extraction, Transform, and Load (ETL). (50 points).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Your notebook from Part 1 but expanded to include graphs, visualizations, and stats that show you can manipulate your data and understand the dataset you are working with. (50 points).
3. A final, in class presentation. (50 points).
4. A final tutorial and website. (100 points).

**A complete version of the assignment can be found at the [Final Tutorial Page](/_projects/FinalTutorial.md).**

### Additional Work for Graduate Students 
Graduate students who enroll in this course will be required to complete their final project/tutorial as an individual.

~~Graduate students who enroll in this course will be required to produce an additional written project which investigates a dataset from their primary field of study.  The report will discuss this dataset and propose an analysis using an advanced technique from Data Science to be decided in conjunction with the instructor.~~

## Policies Related to Turning in Work 

* All work will be turned in on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/).  All work will either be distributed via [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) or in the case of Labs and examples, via the [CMPS 3160 Github Page]().

* All work will be due **at class time on the day assigned**.  This means turning things in during or after class is considered one day late.  This will be consistant throughout the semester.

### Late Work Policy
All work must be turned in on time unless explicit consent for outstanding circumstances is given beforehand (or in the case of illness, with a documented absence after).  Any late work will be penalized at **10% of the total assignment value per day up to 5 days late, after which it will not be accepted**.  The exception to this rule is if work solutions are presented in class (as is the case with labs and quizzes).  **After the work is presented in class, no late work will be accepted.**

### Late Tokens
At the start of this semester you each are holding **3 late tokens** which can be redeemed at any time for **mini-projects, labs, Milestone 1, and Milestone 2 only** .  Each token is worth one additional day, to use at your discretion.  These tokens have no cash value but are worth 1% to your mini-project grade at the end of the semester.  Note that you cannot use a late token if lab solutions have already been presented in class.

## Final Grade Policy 
The weighted average will determine your letter grade roughly as follows, +/- grades will be given for borderline cases.
* A >= 90%
* B >= 80%
* C >= 70%
* D >= 60%
* F < 60% 

**All grades will be posted on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) throughout the semester.**

## Schedule and Workload

See the [Schedule Page](./schedule.md) for the schedule and assignments.

This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work. You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines. Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  

If you need help please check the [discussion board on Canvas!](https://tulane.instructure.com/courses/2220511/discussion_topics). We check it regularly to answer common questions on projects and homeworks.  The solution to your question might already be there!

Students are reminded to make use of office hours.  Please reach out to Prof. Mattei or any of the TAs whenever you need and we can make appointments to meet if you require it.


## Attendance
**Students are required to attend all classes and labs (either in person or virtually) unless they are ill or prevented from attending by exceptional circumstances and with a valid excuse note.** Students are responsible for notifying instructors about absences that result from serious illnesses, injuries, or critical personal problems.  **Students with frequent absences will be reported and/or removed from the course according to university policy.**

Faculty and students must comply with University policies on COVID-19 testing and isolation, which are [located here](https://tulane.edu/covid-19/health-strategies). Faculty and students must wear face coverings in all common areas, including classrooms, and follow social distancing rules. Failure to comply is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and students will be subject to University discipline, which can include suspension or permanent dismissal.

If a student cannot attend class for any reason, the student is responsible for communicating with their instructors to make up any work they may miss. Faculty will provide online options for class participation, outlined in this document, and unless a student is seriously ill, they are expected to use this option. The University Health Center will provide documentation verifying a student is ill, as well as verification that a student may return to class. With the approval of the Newcomb - Tulane College dean, an instructor may have a student who has excessive absences involuntarily withdrawn from a course with a WF grade after written warning at any time during the semester.

# Other Course and Tulane Policies

## Use of Electronic Devices
Please silence your cellphones during class.  If you want to use a laptop or other device with a large screen for note taking please sit in the back rows of the classroom -- it’s distracting to other students [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/)

**Note:** There will be a few “interactive lab days” where we will explicitly encourage you to bring your laptop (if available) and follow along with the tutorial.

## Student Support Services
As we move to remote teaching Tulane has moved a number of student success resources online.  Please visit the [Virtual Learning Student Support Pages](https://success.tulane.edu/virtual-learning-student-support) for more information.

Please come talk to us if you feel you are behind or overwhelmed in this class.  We can work with you and Tulane provides a suite of services to help you succeed in this course including the following.  For more information please visit the [student support services webpage](https://studentaffairs.tulane.edu/).

* Academic Advising - Advising maximizes student potential by sharing information, tools, and resources that empower them to make informed decisions about creating appropriate plans to achieve their academic goals. 
* Academic Learning & Tutoring - The ALTC supports students through supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, writing and presentation consultations, pop-up review sessions, study space, and online learning resources. 
* Case Management and Counseling - Students can leverage support services such as [CAPS for Counseling Services](https://campushealth.tulane.edu/caps), [Case Management and Victim Support Services](https://cmvss.tulane.edu/), and [Goldman Center for Student Accessibility](https://accessibility.tulane.edu/).
* Success Coaching - Coaches help students create actionable steps to meet goals on topics such as college transition, time-management, motivation, testing anxiety, stress management, and decision-making. 

## ADA / Accessibility Statement
Tulane University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability, please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs. Instead, to establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility.  After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Goldman Center contact information: goldman@tulane.edu; (504) 862-8433; [http://accessibility.tulane.edu](http://accessibility.tulane.edu).

## Recording of Class Sessions
Recording class sessions: Classes will be recorded and the recordings will be posted to Canvas. Students may not post a class recording elsewhere, either wholly or in part. Instructors may use a class recording in another course or in a subsequent semester. 

## Code of Academic Conduct and Academic Integrity
This course will follow Tulane's Code of Academic Conduct. Cheating will be reported to the Associate Dean of Newcomb-Tulane College. Discussion is encouraged. However, what you turn in must be your own. You may not read another classmate’s solutions or copy a solution from the web.  **I will be running checks on the code turned in for plagiarism.  If plagiarism is detected the minimum penalty is a 0 on the assignment and being reported, however, you may automatically fail this course at my discretion.**

To be more clear (text from Hal Daumé III): **Any assignment or exam that is handed in must be your own work (unless otherwise stated). However, talking with one another to understand the material better is strongly encouraged.** Recognizing the distinction between cheating and cooperation is very important. If you copy someone else's solution, you are cheating. If you let someone else copy your solution, you are cheating (this includes posting solutions online in a public place). If someone dictates a solution to you, you are cheating.

Everything you hand in must be in your own words, and based on your own understanding of the solution. If someone helps you understand the problem during a high-level discussion, you are not cheating. **We strongly encourage students to help one another understand the material presented in class, in the book, and general issues relevant to the assignments.  We also encourage the use of online resources to understand and clarify things, but not taking results verbatium.** When taking an exam, you must work independently. Any collaboration during an exam will be considered cheating. Any student who is caught cheating will be given an F in the course and referred to the University Office of Student Conduct. Please don't take that chance – if you're having trouble understanding the material, please let me know and I will be more than happy to help.

The Code of Academic Conduct applies to all undergraduate students, full-time and part-time, at Tulane University. Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations (i.e., [Code of Academic Conduct](https://college.tulane.edu/code-of-academic-conduct) and the [Code of Student Conduct](https://conduct.tulane.edu/resources/code-student-conduct)) and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, for conduct judged unsatisfactory or disruptive.

## Title IX
Tulane University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. As such, Tulane is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination including sexual and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence like sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or is experiencing these types of behaviors, know that you are not alone. Resources and support are available: you can learn more at [http://allin.tulane.edu](https://allin.tulane.edu/). Any and all of your communications on these matters will be treated as either “Confidential” or “Private” as explained in the chart below. Please know that if you choose to confide in me I am mandated by the university to report to the Title IX Coordinator, as Tulane and I want to be sure you are connected with all the support the university can offer. You do not need to respond to outreach from the university if you do not want. You can also make a report yourself, including an anonymous report, through the form [http://tulane.edu/concerns](http://tulane.edu/concerns).
