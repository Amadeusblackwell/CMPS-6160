## Workload and Learning Time

This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.
* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  
* Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  
* In order to meet accreditation standards we have over 135 hours of documented learning time this semester.  The following is a rough breakdown of how long you should expect to work on the various types of assignments this semester:  
  * 30 Lectures (1h each), additional readings, review, small assignments (30 mins per lecture).
  * 9 Labs (2h each).
  * Project 0 (5h), Project 1 and 2 (15h each).
  * Milestone 1 and 2 (10h each), Preparing for Final Presentation (5h).
  * Final Project / Notebook (20h in addition to milestones).
  * **Total:** 143 Hours.

## Keeping Track of Assignments

**Note:** The best way to get all the assignments and class is to Clone the Git Repo for the course to your computer.  Then just pull and you'll have all the updates!  You should then **copy these files to one folder where you do all your lab work for the whole semester!**.  Remember, a key part of reproducible research is *staying organized!*

**While I make every effort to keep these tables up to date, if there is ever a conflict on due date, the assignment due date in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) supersedes anything posted here.**

### Standard Rubric for Labs

* (5 Points) *Professionalism*: You have written code that is interpretable -- it contains comments where needed to understand, variable names are reasonable, and code that is reasonable and efficient. You have followed directions to turn in the file, clearly labeling everything. You have cited all sources and how you used them in the written portion of your answers.  There are no unused cells, there are no errors or other distractions.
* (5 Points) *Code*: Code is present for all cells and code is correct and reasonable.
* (5 Points) *Written Answers*: Written answers are present for all cells where asked.  Written answers are complete sentences and clear.
