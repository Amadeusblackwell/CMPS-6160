## Workload and Learning Time

This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.
* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  
* Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  
* In order to meet accreditation standards we have over 135 hours of documented learning time this semester.  The following is a rough breakdown of how long you should expect to work on the various types of assignments this semester:  
  * 30 Lectures (1h each), additional readings, review, small assignments (30 mins per lecture).
  * 9 Labs (2h each).
  * Project 0 (5h), Project 1 and 2 (15h each).
  * Milestone 1 and 2 (10h each), Preparing for Final Presentation (5h).
  * Final Project / Notebook (20h in addition to milestones).
  * **Total:** 143 Hours.

## Keeping Track of Assignments

**Note:** The best way to get all the assignments and class is to Clone the Git Repo for the course to your computer.  Then just pull and you'll have all the updates!  You should then **copy these files to one folder where you do all your lab work for the whole semester!**.  Remember, a key part of reproducible research is *staying organized!*

**While I make every effort to keep these tables up to date, if there is ever a conflict on due date, the assignment due date in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) supersedes anything posted here.**

### Standard Rubric for Labs

* (5 Points) *Professionalism*: You have written code that is interpretable -- it contains comments where needed to understand, variable names are reasonable, and code that is reasonable and efficient. You have followed directions to turn in the file, clearly labeling everything. You have cited all sources and how you used them in the written portion of your answers.
* (5 Points) *Code*: Code is present for all cells, attempt was made to answer all questions.
* (5 Points) *Written Answers*: Written answers are present for all cells where asked.

| Category  | Full    |    75%  |    50%  |   25%   |   0%    |
|:  ----  : | : ---- :| : ---- :| : ---- :| : ---- :| : ---- :|
| Professionalism      | As above. | Some sloppiness, some code not well formatted/ documented. Uncleaned up strings / cells with errors. | More than above, some clearness, unused/unnecessary code. | Code is hard to interpret, many instances of unclear names, unused code, or unnecessary output.  | Many cells that are not necessary, no comments, variable names confused / multiply defined, unclear results. |
| Code            | Code is present for all cells, attempt was made to answer all questions.  | | Code is missing from some cells and/or code is obviously not correct. | | Code missing from many / all answers and/or clearly incorrect / does not run.| 
| Written Answers | Written answers are present for all cells where asked. | | Some written answers missing and/or answers are clearly not correct. | | Answers missing from many / all answers and/or is clearly incorrect / do not address question.
