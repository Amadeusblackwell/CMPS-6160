**Note:** The best way to get all the assignments and class is to Clone the Git Repo for the course to your computer.  Then just pull and you'll have all the updates!  You should then **copy these files to one folder where you do all your lab work for the whole semester!**.  Remember, a key part of reproducible research is *staying organized!*
