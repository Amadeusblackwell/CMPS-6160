* All Demo Notebooks can be [found here on Github](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160/tree/master/_notebooks).

* All slides including the pre-class announcements can be found [(Powerpoint and PDF) here on Google Drive!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MHB57vsMR-00BocZjxsRy2i-ZGSmZhPP?usp=sharing)
